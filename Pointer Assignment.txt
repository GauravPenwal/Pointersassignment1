										Pointer Assignment-1
Q1. Write a program to find out the product of two numbers using pointers.

Sol.
	#include <bits/stdc++.h>
	int main() {
	int x, y;
	cin >> x >> y;
	int *ptrX, *ptrY;
	ptrX = &x;
	ptrY = &y;
	int ans;
	int *ptrAns = &ans;
	*ptrAns = (*ptrX) * (*ptrY);
	cout << *ptrAns << endl;
	return 0;
		}



Q2.int *p, q; What does both of these terms signify?

Sol. p is a pointer and q is an integer. * is grouped with variables, not data types.


Q3. Predict the output of the following code snippet.
int a = 10, b = 20;
int *ptr = &a;
b = *ptr + 1;
ptr = &b;
cout << *ptr << ‘ ‘ << a << ‘ ‘ << b;

Sol.
11 10 11
ptr points to a, b = a + 1 , so ptr points to b



Q4. Predict the output of the following code snippet.
int a = 15, b = 20;
int *ptr = &a;
int *ptr2 = &b;
*ptr = *ptr2;

Sol. a gets the value of b


Q5.Predict the output of the following code snippet.
int a = 10, b = 20;
int *ptr;
*ptr = 5;

Sol. Runtime error
